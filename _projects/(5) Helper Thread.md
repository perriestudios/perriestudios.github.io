description: Designed a lightweight helper thread for the RISC-V Vanilla core used in the HammerBlade manycore. Implemented in a way similar to simultaneous multithreading, with the helper thread having a dedicated ALU while sharing the other resources in the pipeline. Benchmarked the performance of the system with memcpy.
