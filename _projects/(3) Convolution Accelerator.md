description: A massively parallel 2D convolution hardware accelerator targeted at Image Processing applications. Performance gain is through parallelism and short I/O datapath. Implemented a tiled array of 6x4 processing elements that computes convolution between a 3x3 pixel array and kernel. Performed floorplanning with FreePDK45 for synthesis and OpenRAM for SRAM macro integration.
