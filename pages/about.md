# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm currently pursing a masters degree at the University of Washington where I'm advised by Prof. Scott Hauck. I have a breath of experience across the hardware side of things on the computing stack from transistor level VLSI Design to application level Embedded Systems Design.
